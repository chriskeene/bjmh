All papers that the Editors consider appropriate for publication will be submitted to at least two suitably qualified reviewers for comment. Subsequent publication is dependent on receiving satisfactory comments from reviewers. All authors will be sent copies of the comments from the reviewers.</p><p>The Editors are keen to encourage article submissions from a variety of scholars and authors regardless of their academic background. For those papers that demonstrate great promise and significant research but are offered by authors who have yet to publish or who need further editorial support, the Editors are willing to offer mentoring and guidance to ensure an article’s successful publication.</p><p>The Editorial Team is particularly keen to consider articles on subjects that might not ordinarily receive much attention but which clearly show the topic has been properly researched and for which the author does not receive any external financial support.</p><p>The Editors will provide authors with additional supoort on a case-by-case basis. If authors wish to take advantage of this Editorial Support Service then they should provide an outline of their background and explain how they believe the Editors can help when they submit their paper.</p><p>The Editorial Team makes every effort to offer this service in a transparent manner and so will publish their reasons for supporting the author at the same time that their article appears in the BJMH.</p><p>Articles should be no more than 8000 words in length (including footnotes) and be set out according the BJMH Style Guide. Authors should note that articles will usually be rejected – unless the author has indicated that they wish to take advantage of our Editorial Support Service – if they do not conform to the Chicago Manual of Style or if they go over the word count.</p><p>The editors may suggest changes to articles and book reviews in the interest of clarity and economy of expression; such changes will not be made without consultation with the author. The editors are the final arbiters of usage, grammar, and length.</p><p>Authors are encouraged to supply relevant artwork (maps, charts, line drawings, and photographs) with their essays.

    'en_US' => 'The copyediting stage is intended to improve the flow, clarity, grammar, wording, and formatting of the article. It represents the last chance for the author to make any substantial changes to the text because the next stage is restricted to typos and formatting corrections. The file to be copyedited is in Word or .rtf format and therefore can easily be edited as a word processing document. The set of instructions displayed here proposes two approaches to copyediting. One is based on Microsoft Word\'s Track Changes feature and requires that the copy editor, editor, and author have access to this program. A second system, which is software independent, has been borrowed, with permission, from the Harvard Educational Review. The journal editor is in a position to modify these instructions, so suggestions can be made to improve the process for this journal.<h4>Copyediting Systems</h4><strong>1. Microsoft Word\'s Track Changes</strong> Under Tools in the menu bar, the feature Track Changes enables the copy editor to make insertions (text appears in color) and deletions (text appears crossed out in color or in the margins as deleted). The copy editor can posit queries to both the author (Author Queries) and to the editor (Editor Queries) by inserting these queries in square brackets. The copyedited version is then uploaded, and the editor is notified. The editor then reviews the text and notifies the author. The editor and author should leave those changes with which they are satisfied. If further changes are necessary, the editor and author can make changes to the initial insertions or deletions, as well as make new insertions or deletions elsewhere in the text. Authors and editors should respond to each of the queries addressed to them, with responses placed inside the square brackets. After the text has been reviewed by editor and author, the copy editor will make a final pass over the text accepting the changes in preparation for the layout and galley stage. <strong>2. Harvard Educational Review </strong> <strong>Instructions for Making Electronic Revisions to the Manuscript</strong> Please follow the following protocol for making electronic revisions to your manuscript: <strong>Responding to suggested changes.</strong>   For each of the suggested changes that you accept, unbold the text.   For each of the suggested changes that you do not accept, re-enter the original text and <strong>bold</strong> it. <strong>Making additions and deletions.</strong>   Indicate additions by <strong>bolding</strong> the new text.   Replace deleted sections with: <strong>[deleted text]</strong>.   If you delete one or more sentence, please indicate with a note, e.g., <strong>[deleted 2 sentences]</strong>. <strong>Responding to Queries to the Author (QAs).</strong>   Keep all QAs intact and bolded within the text. Do not delete them.   To reply to a QA, add a comment after it. Comments should be delimited using: <strong>[Comment:]</strong>   e.g., <strong>[Comment: Expanded discussion of methodology as you suggested]</strong>. <strong>Making comments.</strong>   Use comments to explain organizational changes or major revisions   e.g., <strong>[Comment: Moved the above paragraph from p. 5 to p. 7].</strong>  Note: When referring to page numbers, please use the page numbers from the printed copy of the manuscript that was sent to you. This is important since page numbers may change as a document is revised electronically.<h4>An Illustration of an Electronic Revision</h4><ol><li><strong>Initial copyedit.</strong> The journal copy editor will edit the text to improve flow, clarity, grammar, wording, and formatting, as well as including author queries as necessary. Once the initial edit is complete, the copy editor will upload the revised document through the journal Web site and notify the author that the edited manuscript is available for review.</li><li><strong>Author copyedit.</strong> Before making dramatic departures from the structure and organization of the edited manuscript, authors must check in with the editors who are co-chairing the piece. Authors should accept/reject any changes made during the initial copyediting, as appropriate, and respond to all author queries. When finished with the revisions, authors should rename the file from AuthorNameQA.doc to AuthorNameQAR.doc (e.g., from LeeQA.doc to LeeQAR.doc) and upload the revised document through the journal Web site as directed.</li><li><strong>Final copyedit.</strong> The journal copy editor will verify changes made by the author and incorporate the responses to the author queries to create a final manuscript. When finished, the copy editor will upload the final document through the journal Web site and alert the layout editor to complete formatting.</li></ol>',

Some have been serving or retired members of the Armed Forces; some academics or aspiring academics; and some - most welcome of all – amateurs who write for the sheer love of it. The continuing demand for their work is evidenced in every major bookshop, where ‘Military History’ shelves often take up as much space as does mere ‘History’. Even those whose primary interest is not military history as such now realise that a knowledge of the subject is necessary if they are to understand the past, to say nothing of the present. Military history is now too important to be left to the military historians.</p><p>For the past few years military historians have been able to communicate with each another at the annual meetings of the British Commission of Military History and through its publication <em>Mars and Clio</em>. Now the BJMH will make their work available to a far wider readership and should attract an increasing number of contributors. It will be not only British, and not only military historians who will wish it well." </p><p align="right">Professor Sir Michael Howard</p>',
